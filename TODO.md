# Things TODO

## Add a `details` part to errors
Right now errors only give basic info which is not very helpful
make current error value a `message` field and add a `details` field that includes `err` from functions

## Store every game move
Add function to QuartoStorage interface for storing GameMove

## User checks
Handle same user being able to be added twice to stuff

## Git commit and date vars
Add git commit and date variables to `/info` endpoint
